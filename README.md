# `dfxdemo`

`dfxdemo` is a simple Python-based demo that demonstrates how to use the
DeepAffex‚Ñ¢ Extraction SDK and DeepAffex‚Ñ¢ Cloud API.

The demo can extract facial blood-flow from a video file or from a webcam, send
it to the DeepAffex‚Ñ¢ Cloud for processing and display the results. (This
process is called 'making a measurement'.) It can also be used to display
historical results or to view study details.

## Register for an DeepAffex‚Ñ¢ Cloud API license

If you haven't already done so, the first step is to register for a DeepAffex‚Ñ¢
developer account and request a cloud API license key. You can do this by
visiting the [DFX Dashboard](https://dashboard.deepaffex.ai/) and selecting the
Sign Up link at the bottom.

## Copy your license key

Once you are logged in to the Dashboard, you will see a Licenses section on the
left. Clicking on it will reveal your organization license that you can use in
the subsequent steps. Please click on the eye-icon (üëÅÔ∏è) to reveal your
license and copy and save it locally. (You will need it for registering later.)

## Prerequisites

Please ensure you have the following software installed:

* [Python 3.7 or newer (64-bit)](https://www.python.org/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* C++ compiler and toolchain, capable of compiling Python extensions:
  * Windows: [Visual Studio 2017 or newer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
  * macOS (untested): [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
  * Linux: gcc

  Note: On Ubuntu 18.04, the following commands should work

  ```shell
  sudo apt-get install build-essential git # Compiler and Git
  sudo apt-get install python3.8-dev python3.8-venv # or 3.7
  sudo apt-get install python3-mediainfodll # for pymediainfo
  sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev # for Dlib
  ```

## Install `dfxdemo`

Clone the dfxdemo application from Github.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/nuralogix/dfx-demo-py
```

Create a Python virtual environment inside the cloned repo, activate it and
upgrade `pip`

  ```shell
  cd dfx-demo-py
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate # on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
  ```

Download the [Python wheel for the DFX SDK](https://deepaffex.ai/developers-sdk)
for your platform and install it in the Python virtual environment.

```shell
pip install /path/to/download/libdfxpython.whl
```

Install `dfxdemo` in editable mode (and automatically install other
dependencies.) This may take a while as [Dlib](http://dlib.net/) gets compiled.

```shell
pip install -e .
```

## Run `dfxdemo`

`dfxdemo` has top-level commands that roughly correspond to the way the DFX API
is organized. All commands and subcommands have a `--help` argument.

### Register your license

Register your organization license on the DeepAffex‚Ñ¢ Cloud to obtain a *device
token*. This is generally the first thing you have to do (unless you don't want
to make a measurement.)

```shell
python dfxdemo.py org register <your_license_key>
```

**Note**: By default, the demo stores tokens in a file called `config.json`.
*In a production application, you will need to manage all tokens securely.*

### Login

Login as a user to obtain a *user token*.

```shell
python dfxdemo.py user login <email> <password>
```

**Note**: All the commands below, use the tokens obtained above.

---

### Studies

List the available DFX Studies and retrieve the details of the one you want to
use.

Note: The DeepAffex‚Ñ¢ Cloud organizes around the concept of Studies - a DFX
Study is a collection of biosignals of interest that are computed in one
measurement.

```shell
python dfxdemo.py studies list
python dfxdemo.py study get <study_id>
```

Select a study for use in measurements.

```shell
python dfxdemo.py study select <study_id>
```

### Measurements

Please download and unzip http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2 into 'dfxutils/res' folder


Make a measurement from a video using the selected study

   ```shell
   python dfxdemo.py measure make /path/to/video_file
   ```

or

Make a measurment from a webcam using the selected study

  ```shell
  python dfxdemo.py measure make_camera
  ```

Retrieve detailed results of the last measurement

```shell
python dfxdemo.py measure get
```

List historical measurements

```shell
python dfxdemo.py measurements list
```
